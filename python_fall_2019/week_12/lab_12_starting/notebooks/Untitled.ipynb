    "### The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space [1, 2, 1] has one axis. That axis has 3 elements in it, so we say it has a length of 3. In the example pictured below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "[[ 1., 0., 0.],\n",
    " [ 0., 1., 2.]]\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy’s array class is called ndarray. It is also known by the alias array. Note that numpy.array is not the same as the Standard Python Library class array.array, which only handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality. The more important attributes of an ndarray object are:\n",
    "\n",
    "ndarray.ndim\n",
    "    the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.\n",
    "ndarray.shape\n",
    "    the dimensions of the array. This is a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with n rows and m columns, shape will be (n,m). The length of the shape tuple is therefore the number of axes, ndim.\n",
    "ndarray.size\n",
    "    the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape.\n",
    "ndarray.dtype\n",
    "    an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can create or specify dtype’s using standard Python types. Additionally NumPy provides types of its own. numpy.int32, numpy.int16, and numpy.float64 are some examples.\n",
    "ndarray.itemsize\n",
    "    the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type float64 has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to ndarray.dtype.itemsize.\n",
    "ndarray.data\n",
    "    the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally, we won’t need to use this attribute because we will access the elements in an array using indexing facilities.\n",

    "Array Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can create an array from a regular Python list or tuple using the array function. The type of the resulting array is deduced from the type of the elements in the sequences.\n",

    ">>> b.dtype\n",
    "dtype('float64')\n",
    "\n",
    "A frequent error consists in calling array with multiple numeric arguments, rather than providing a single list of numbers as an argument.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> a = np.array(1,2,3,4)    # WRONG\n",
    ">>> a = np.array([1,2,3,4])  # RIGHT\n",
    "\n",
    "array transforms sequences of sequences into two-dimensional arrays, sequences of sequences of sequences into three-dimensional arrays, and so on.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> b = np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)])\n",
    ">>> b\n",
    "array([[ 1.5,  2. ,  3. ],\n",
    "       [ 4. ,  5. ,  6. ]])\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of the array can also be explicitly specified at creation time:\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> c = np.array( [ [1,2], [3,4] ], dtype=complex )\n",
    ">>> c\n",
    "array([[ 1.+0.j,  2.+0.j],\n",
    "       [ 3.+0.j,  4.+0.j]])\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the elements of an array are originally unknown, but its size is known. Hence, NumPy offers several functions to create arrays with initial placeholder content. These minimize the necessity of growing arrays, an expensive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function zeros creates an array full of zeros, the function ones creates an array full of ones, and the function empty creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory. By default, the dtype of the created array is float64.\n",

    "    the second-to-last is printed from top to bottom,\n",
    "    the rest are also printed from top to bottom, with each slice separated from the next by an empty line.\n",
