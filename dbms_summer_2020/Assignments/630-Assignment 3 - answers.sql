-- Q1: For the bank database given in class, write a SQL command that prints the names of all customers whose accounts and loans in Edina are in different branches (in other words, the customers we want are the ones whose set of account branches and loan branches in Edina DO NOT intersect. For example, Jones who has an account in France and a loan also in France, is NOT one of the answers).
----customers who have accounts in Edina branches
select a1.cname
from account a1, branch b
where a1.bname=b.bname AND
      lower(b.bcity)='edina' AND
	  NOT EXISTS
	  (--The results of intersect
		--branches of the customer's loans in Edina

		   AND l.cname=a1.cname
		intersect 
		--branches of the customer's accounts in Edina
