Based on the Elaboration, there are seven (7) wireframes/screens to create.

Questions:
- When does the user create a password?
- Should the Elaboration only be for one user?

I think the Elaboration should only be for one user because it's difficult to create a wireframe narrative for two users. If the purpose of two users is two show entering macros and calories, I'd argue we do that by creating a profile screen and having the user change from calories to macros and generating new suggestions, which we do at the end anyway.

I think entering favorite ingredients should come immediately after entering macros or calories.

Thoughts?

Screen One:
- login or
- register

Screen Two:
- register
- enter name
- enter email

Screen Three:
- message to user to check email and verify account

Screen Four:
- verification is complete message
- enter macros; communicate to user they should already have their macro data

Screen Five:
- ask for favorite ingredients

Screen Six:
- show meal options

Screen Seven:
- show user profile
- change from macros to calories or vise versa
- update password
- update email
