project vision
- web/browser app
- users should also be able to add macros
	- so these things
		- age
		- weight
		- height
		- targeted weight loss
		- macros
			- carbs
			- fat
			- protein

project boundaries
	a. ok - for something like this i'd argue that javascript can handle the backend and the frontend, and make this fully compatible in all browsers. i realize this program doesn't teach javascript, but we all know it should. it can do the heavy lifting as much as anything.
	b. why only compilable with IE and Chrome?
	c. why not compatible with firefox?
	d. vegan label?
	e. ok
	f. ok
	g. explain

requirements
	a. ok
	b. target weight or target macros? weight loss is a much longer term goal. the daily goal should be eating within a macro (carbs, fat, protein) goal.
	c. ok
	d. yes!
	e. i think this should be macros
	f. is there an api we can connect to (in theory)

business case and initial cost estimate
	a. yes, but i'd argue what the teams needs is to create an algorithm to do the calculations
